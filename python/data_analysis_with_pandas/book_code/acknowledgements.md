# Acknowledgements

Writing this book has been a tremendous amount of work, but I have grown a lot through the experience: as a writer, as a technologist, and as a person. This wouldn't have been possible without the help I received along the way. It was truly touching to see that friends, family, and colleagues were so willing to help. I'm very grateful to you all.

To my family. **Mom**: for always being there when I needed to vent after working multiple 14 hour days straight writing this book and making sure I had something to eat...and not getting too upset when it took me months to find the time to look into the Japan itinerary. Y ahora, por fin, puedo tomar esa clase de Zumba contigo. **Ryan**: for the sports resources in chapter 12 and always telling it like it is. **Dad**: for sharing a countdown with me.

To my friend and reviewer, **Aliki Mavromoustaki**: It's rare to meet someone over video conference and instantly form a friendship, but I am very happy our paths crossed. Even though I told you this was an offer you could refuse, you took on the extra work to review the first drafts, ŒµœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑœé. We finally got to work on something together!

To **Felipe Moreno**: for being an extremely supportive manager and my toughest critic. You managed to fit more writing into the margins of each page than I would have thought possible. While this led to rewriting large portions of the earlier chapters for the final drafts, I know it made a huge difference in the quality of the final outcome. Obrigada!

To **Suphannee Sivakorn**: for volunteering to review the drafts. I know you thought I wouldn't make it past chapter 5, but you didn't really know me then...‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞ (ka ka ka üïäÔ∏è) for all the drawings (and occasional poem). They made me smile when I really needed it and kept me sane. Now, I have a poem for you:

    <em>
        Roses are red,<br/>
        violets are blue;<br/>
        I'm done with this book,<br/>
        and so are you.
    </em>

To my colleagues. **Lucy Hao** and **Javon Thompson**: for reviewing the financial analysis code and chapter 7 despite never having met me. Lucy, I am very glad I got the chance to meet you when I gave my lightning talk at the Princeton office. You reassured me that the content of this book is relevant and useful to its audience, and it sounded like you got just as much out of the experience of reviewing that chapter as I did. **Alexander Comerford**: for additional resources in chapter 12 and knitting me desk gloves (paws?) for work. You kept my fingers from freezing, so I could write this book. I'm still waiting for my blanket though...

Finally, thank you to everyone else that helped along the way whether it was support, kind words, or being a sounding board I truly appreciate it, and it made a difference.
