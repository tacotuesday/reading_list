## Book Description
Data analysis has become an essential skill in a variety of domains where knowing how to work with data and extract insights can generate significant value.

*Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas* will show you how to analyze your data, get started with machine learning, and work effectively with Python libraries often used for data science, such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Using real-world datasets, you will learn how to use the powerful pandas library to perform data wrangling to reshape, clean, and aggregate your data. Then, you will learn how to conduct exploratory data analysis by calculating summary statistics and visualizing the data to find patterns. In the concluding chapters, you will explore some applications of anomaly detection, regression, clustering, and classification, using scikit-learn, to make predictions based on past data.

By the end of this book, you will be equipped with the skills you need to use pandas to ensure the veracity of your data, visualize it for effective decision-making, and reliably reproduce analysis across multiple domains.

- Utilize computer science concepts and algorithms to write more efficient code for data analysis
- Write and run simulations

## Table of Contents
- [Chapter 1, *Introduction to Data Analysis*](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/ch_01), will teach you the fundamentals of data analysis, give you a foundation in statistics, and get your environment set up for working with data in Python and using Jupyter Notebooks.

- [Chapter 2, *Working with Pandas DataFrames*](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/ch_02), introduces you to the `pandas` library and shows you the basics of working with `DataFrames`.

- [Chapter 3, *Data Wrangling with Pandas*](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/ch_03), discusses the process of data manipulation, shows you how to explore an API to gather data, and guides you through data cleaning and reshaping with pandas.

- [Chapter 4, *Aggregating Pandas DataFrames*](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/ch_04), teaches you how to query and merge DataFrames, perform complex operations on them, including rolling calculations and aggregations, and how to work effectively with time series data.

- [Chapter 5, *Visualizing Data with Pandas and Matplotlib*](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/ch_05), shows you how to create your own data visualizations in Python, first using the `matplotlib` library, and then directly from `pandas` objects.

- [Chapter 6, *Plotting with Seaborn and Customization Techniques*](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/ch_06), continues the discussion on data visualization by teaching you how to use the `seaborn` library for visualizing your long form data and giving you the tools you need to customize your visualizations, making them presentation-ready.

- [Chapter 7, *Financial Analysis: Bitcoin and the Stock Market*](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/ch_07), walks you through the creation of a [Python package for analyzing stocks](https://github.com/stefmolin/stock-analysis), building upon everything learned in chapters 1-6 and applying it to a financial application.

## Notes on Environment Setup
Environment setup instructions are in the chapter 1 of the text. If you don't have the book, you must install Python 3.6 or higher, [set up a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment), [activate it](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment), and then [install the packages listed in requirements.txt](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-requirements-files). You can then launch JupyterLab and use the ch_01/checking_your_setup.ipynb Jupyter notebook to check your setup. Consult [this resource](https://anbasile.github.io/programming/2017/06/25/jupyter-venv/) if you have issues with using your virtual environment in Jupyter.

## Solutions
Each chapter comes with exercises. The solutions for chapters 1-11 can be found [here](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/solutions).
